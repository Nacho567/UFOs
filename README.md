# UFOs
Module 12: JavaScript

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

This website was created to help search through all of the reported sighting of possible UFOs across the world. Not only can sightings be searched for by date, but they can also be searched via the city, state, country, and reported shape. This should help all of those UFO theorists get their fix in.

### **Results**

If someone wants to search for sightings, they need to pick the options and put them in a search that matches the placeholders and then hit enter. For example, these options could be entered: Roswell, CA, US, and/or circle.

### **Summary**

While this search table works, there could always be improvements. A couple ways to improve the table would be as you type, results could autopopulate from the data. This way you might not even need to press enter to find what you want, or to find out that a result isn't in the database. For some of the filters with less options (shape, state, country) a dropdown menu could also work to make it more streamlined.
